			Elements of the Genre
		</h2>

		The sports genre involves simulating the experience of playing a fictional or non-fictional sport. Games of this genre allow the player to play as a participant of a sporting event, which can involve working as a team, or competing individually, depending on the type of sport being simulated. While this is the main aspect of the game, the player may also take on responsibility over strategies behind the sport, involving them in decision making processes which can affect gameplay.
